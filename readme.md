Arrow is the free, open-source and feature-rich tool for
*game narrative* design, *text-adventure* development,
and creation of *interactive nonlinear storytelling* documents.

![Arrow's Overall Look][arrow-screenshot]

Notable Features:

+ Free as in Freedom

Arrow supports a rich palette of features, from scenes and macros, to variables and characters.
It also comes with built-in common node types, providing logic, interactive navigation, random data generation,
state management, and more.

> Check out [Guides](#guides) for detailed information.


## Download

Arrow prebuilt executables are available to download from the archive of [releases].

Following links are to the *fairly stable most recent* versions:

+ Linux (X11) [x86_64 (64-bit)][linux-x11-x86-64-latest]
+ Windows [64-bit][win-64-latest]

> For other platforms and architectures, or to take advantage of the latest features in the main branch
> consider [building or running Arrow from source][wiki-build-from-source].


## Web App

Arrow is also available as a [Progressive Web App][web-app].

The app tries to provide the core features on a par with the most recent downloadable releases.  
The most critical difference is that ***it stores project data and configurations in your browser***.  
Additional import & export conveniences are available to ease working with file-system of your device.

> **Note!**  
> Due to the nature of browsers, **certain features may be limited or not available in web app** versions.  
> We *highly recommend prioritizing use of Arrow for desktop (OS platforms)* whenever possible.  
> Currently known limited features on browsers include:
> loading fonts from the user's system (affecting Unicode support), window management conveniences and incremental exports.  

> PWA version requires your browser to have `WebGl` and `Canvas` element support,
> available `Web-Storage`, and `Java-Script` enabled (which any *modern browser* does by default).

> The experience is optimized for medium-large screens.


## Runtime Projects

+ [Official HTML-JS Runtime][runtime-html-js]
    > Bundled with Arrow, this runtime is used in playable exports.


## Guides

Docs for Arrow are available in the [repository's Wiki][wiki-home],
including a [Quick Start Guide][wiki-quick-start-guide] as well as,
detailed instructions, documentation of the built-in nodes, and more.
